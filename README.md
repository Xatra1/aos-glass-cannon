# Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow - Glass Cannon

AoS Glass Cannon turns the game into a brutal journey, where Soma can die in as little as 2 hits. However, Soma slowly gains substantial strength and additional weapons throughout the game, allowing him to defeat enemies easily. With certain enemies no longer dropping their abilities, Soma must venture further into the castle to unlock them. Some abilities are also changed, allowing for new strategies in defeating foes.

### Additional Changes:
* Cutscenes can now be skipped on new saves.

* White Dragon, Skeleton Knight, Ghost Dancer, Minotaur, Gremlin, Golem, Triton, Gorgon, Dead Crusader, Quetzalcoatl, Werejaguar, Weretiger, Man-Eater, Lightning Doll, Biphron, Alastor, Flame Demon, Succubus, Curly, Manticore, and Devil no longer drop their souls. They can be found in canisters in other areas.  
* Flesh Golem, Mimic, Altair, and Tsuchinoko no longer drop their soul. (Their souls no longer contribute to the soul completion percentage either, so obtaining 100% in the enemy list is still possible.)  
* Certain souls were changed completely.  
* Some items were shifted around to better fit the hack's stat changes.  
* The Shop has been removed.  
* A warp room has been added to the Chaotic Realm.  
* The Underground Reservoir room connected to the Castle Corridor has a boss door, blocking entry until Death is defeated. (You can still enter the area itself to get the Pendant.)  
* The Floating Garden entrance has a boss door, blocking entry until Headhunter is defeated. (This prevents the Malphas skip.)  
* The Inner Quarters -> Castle Corridor shortcut has a boss door, blocking entry until Big Golem is defeated. (This prevents a skip with Flying Armor + Malphas.)  
* The Castle Corridor now has a moving platform in the Fire Armor room, allowing for access to the Copper Plate room without having Malphas.  
* The Chapel now has two crumbling platforms and two moving platforms in the Manticore room, allowing for access to the top of the room without having any flight souls.
* The Ghost Dancer room in the Chapel now has a gate + button, blocking a sequence break.  
* The Study now has a crumbling platform, allowing you to get the Hammer without Malphas.  
* The Study now has a boss door blocking off the area where an Uncurse Potion would be in the vanilla game, blocking entry until Great Armor is defeated.  
* The room with a breakable ceiling in the Dance Hall now has the breakable ceiling removed and a moving platform added, allowing the player to get into the room without any flight souls.  
* The same room as mentioned above also has a boss door in front of it's entrance, blocking entry until Big Golem is defeated.  
* The room with a breakable wall in the Clock Tower now has the breakable wall removed and a moving platform added, allowing the player to get over the spikes easily.  
* The Underground Reservoir now has a few rooms with modified tiles, allowing for more linear travel through the area.  
* The Waterfall room in the Underground Reservoir now has several moving platforms, allowing you to traverse the room without any flight abilities.  
* The vertical Gargoyle room in the Arena now has a boss door, blocking entry until Balore is defeated.  

### Known Issues:
* Some platforms, buttons and gates have a darkened palette.  
* Gates that are not part of the vanilla game keep their collision after being lowered. Leave and re-enter the room you opened them in to solve this.  
* The background tiles in the waterfall room will split to reveal a line of green tiles once it starts scrolling.  
* The "1" in Balore's HP value stays on the screen when navigating through pages in the bestiary.
